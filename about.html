                        <p id="about_whatdoido_text">I enjoy designing digital solutions that improve people’s lives, jobs, and experiences. Solving problems scratches the itch for the left side of my brain, and doing so through visually appealing designs gives the right side of my brain the warm and fuzzies. My strong suits are building mutually beneficial working relationships with end users and creating logical UI flows based on their needs. </p>

                            <h1 class="section_heading">How did I get into UX?</h1>
                            <p>I started my career in the tech industry as a software engineer. I quickly realized that I enjoyed working with people more than I did writing code. I transitioned into a product management role, where I was able to work closely with users to understand their needs and pain points. This experience sparked my interest in user experience design, and I decided to pursue a career in this field.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In high school and going into college, I developed a strong passion for photography and videography. At the peak of that pursuit, I was able to film professional motocross riders and races, as well as college football and basketball games. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I graduated college with a major in economics and a minor in finance. At my first place of employment, there was an opportunity (a total void) for UI design. Having photo and video editing skills, I started out utilizing primitive tools to make UI layouts. As you can imagine, I quickly learned there is more to UI design than a pretty layout. This is when I started to really learn about the total UX design process and gain experience implementing it. Fast forward, and I’ve been full-time designing for the past 4-5 years, improving with every new challenge.</p>
