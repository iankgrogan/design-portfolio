                        <p>This is a portfolio-building project to step out of my usual box of SaaS logistics applications and design a new feature for an existing mobile application. I myself am a user of Coinbase and have had a desire for a feature where I could communicate with other Coinbase users to better understand market sentiment.</p>

                        <p>If this were a real project, the goal would be to provide a community where Coinbase users can connect with each other regarding an asset of their interest, resulting in increased time spent by users viewing a particular asset and an increase in the likelihood of them executing more transactions on Coinbase.</p>

                <p>This project was a great experience for me in designing with the mobile-first mindset. I’ve designed for mobile before, but it was never the primary focus. This project also a great representation of how I am able to tap into an existing design system and create something that fits in seamlessly, as mentioned by one of the users. I’m happy with the overall solution I presented and wish this were in front of more users for more feedback.</p>
